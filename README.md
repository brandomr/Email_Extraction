Email_Extraction
================

Ever had a list of e-mails in a CSV (spreadsheet) that you have wanted to get into semi-colon delimitted list for batch e-mailing purposes?

Ever had this list of e-mails embedded in cells containing things *other* than e-mails? For example, someone decided to put "brandomr, 888-888-8888, brandomr@brandomr.com" all in the same cell!?

Well, this R script will look for the "contact" column in your .CSV file and deal with this for you.
